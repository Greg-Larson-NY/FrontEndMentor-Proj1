# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component Challenge

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
The designs were created to the following widths:
- Mobile: 375px https://greg-larson-ny.github.io/FrontEndMentor-Proj1/design/mobile-design.jpg
- Desktop: 1440px https://greg-larson-ny.github.io/FrontEndMentor-Proj1/design/desktop-design.jpg

  The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that I needed to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

The required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


# Introduction

I decided in order to keep working on coding until new projects developed that FrontEnd Mentor Projects were perhaps just the thing I needed to keep me from losing skills I gained in my coding bootcamp and gain new ones along the way. This was my first challenge completed in a few hours. 

## Challenges

After taking a few weeks off from coding I realize how much you lose so quickly but how much you regain with practice as well. My biggest challenge with this project was again breaking this down into how it was possibly put together and then making it responsive after. I find myself once again falling into the trap of desktop first when in fact I think I really need to embrace the mobile first method.
